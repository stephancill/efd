# ðŸŒˆ Ethereum Friend Directory

Ethereum Friend Directory is a blockchain-based social graph which allows users to maintain a list of mutual connections. This list of connections can be accessed by any app on the decentralized web to allow for social use cases e.g. a portable following/follower list.

## How it works

Requests are created and accepted off-chain. This is the most cost-effective way of facilitating this interaction. An implementation of these methods can be found in the tests directory.

1. Alice creates a request by signing the hash of a message which contains her and Bob's address and sends it to Bob
2. Bob signs the same message with Alice's signature added in
3. Bob or Alice can confirm the request at any time by submitting it to the contract's `confirmRequest` method
4. Bob's address is added to Alice's set in the `adj` mapping and Alice to Bob's

- The adjacency list for each user in `adj` is read by the client to display who is friends with who.
- ENS is used to resolve ENS domains and profile images

## Installation

```
yarn
```

## Development

### Contract
```
yarn run node
```

In a separate terminal, to generate random data for the built in accounts:
```
yarn dev
```

### Client
```
cd client
yarn start
```

## Tests
```
yarn test
```

## Deployment

### Contracts

1. Update network in `hardhat.config.js`
2. `npx hardhat run deploy --network [network name]`

### Client

1. `cd client`
2. Add addresses for `PublicResolver`, `ReverseRegistrar`, `ReverseRecords`, `ENS` in `client/deployments/map.json` (and `EFD` if using an existing contract)
3. Build using `yarn build`

### Deploy client to IPFS using [ipfs-deploy](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-deploy)

1. Install ipfs-deploy
```
npm install -g ipfs-deploy
```

2. Deploy app
```
npx ipfs-deploy build
```

3. Visit the HTTP gateway URL to check if it worked.
